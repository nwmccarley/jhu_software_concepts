This is my program to generate my personal wepbage using blueprints and Flask for Module one. It is based on the Module 1 content and readings. It contains 3 python files. __init___.py and pages.py that Flask expects to adhere to the structure outlined in the reading as well as run.py to run the program. The pages file is where the Blueprints are set up. Their are corresponding blueprints for each page, one that applies to each page (base.html), and one for the required navigator banner. There is also a styles.css page thatis used too customize the look and layout of the webpages that are generated. Lastly their is a banner.PNG image file containing the required image for the Module.
