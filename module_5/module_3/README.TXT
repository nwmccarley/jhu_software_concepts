2. Module 3 we are tasked with taking the data we created in Module 2 and putting it in a SQL Database, we then need to perform postgres SQL queries to analyze this data and answer questions. The answers are then displayed to a Flask webpage. Due 6/8/2025
3. For my approach I used psycopg2 to connect to SQL, json to handle the json files, datetime to create the data type date where needed, and flask to creat the flask webpage. This program works first by using load_data.py to load the applicants.json file into a SQL database. Items are added 1000 at a time and a message is printed so the user knows the status of the program.For this database the columns program and university are combined and the other columns are consistent with the assignment and the data types match what is needed. Then query_data is used to perform SQL querys to get the required answers for the questions using postgres sql. A description of the querys can be found in the attached answers.pdf file. Each answer is saved into a value to be imported to the app.py. Finally the results are displayed into a Flask wepbage using css for styling on app.py. All answers are rounded to two decimal places for readbility since it was not specificed for some of the prompts.
4. No bugs are known but since this is a large dataset the Load_data does take a few minutes to run. Comments on the reliability of the data can be found in limitations.pdf.
