2. Module 5 we are tasked with taking our module 3 code and making it pylint compliant with a 10/10 score for each python file. We then need to update our sql statements to meet the listed SQL injection defences. Finally we need to generate the depedency graphusing pydeps. Due 6/8/2025
3. For my approach I ran lint to ensure every program has a 10/10 lint score. Most of the changes involved tweaking line lengths. Next I updated the SQL statements to meet the requirments listed in the assignments while maintaining the same functionality as before. I then reran lint to update my 10/10 compatibility. Finally I generated the dependency.svg file to view the dependencies. This file can be found at dependency.svg. There is also dependency.pdf that contains my description of how the dependencies works.
4. No bugs are known but in early builds I had issues importing psycopg2. Because of this I had to creat a new app in replit, so there may be some descrepencies in my commit count in github. This app was iterated and push to github consistently.
